## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Javascript DOM manipulation

&nbsp;  
### What I learned

This was my first project properly using CSS grid and it was amazing. It saved me so much time in just being able to setup the page properly right from the get go.

&nbsp;  
### Continued development

Switching from desktop view to mobile view and vice versa keeps tripping me up a bit, so I am keen to continue practicing that.
